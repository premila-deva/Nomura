    <h4>Message from the President and Group CEO</h4>
    <article>
      <p>The finance industry has seen rapid changes in the business environment, mainly driven by digitalization, the declining birth rate and aging population in Japan, and enhanced global regulations. Nomura is committed to taking the firm to greater heights in order to deliver consistent growth under the changing environment. We will focus efforts on growing our business, earning society's trust and ensuring employee satisfaction.</p>
      <p>To grow our business, we will increase productivity of existing businesses as well as expand into new areas. We will also work to ensure the increasingly diverse and sophisticated needs of our clients are met, by expanding the scope of our business from public-side services, such as public equity and public and corporate bonds, to private-side products and services, such as private equity and privately placed bonds.</p>
      <p>As we actively pursue new areas of business, we remain committed to our enduring mission to enrich society through our expertise in the capital markets. We will strengthen our ESG initiatives while placing continued emphasis on earning society's trust and ensuring our people are happy and fulfilled.</p>
      <p>We believe that helping to create a sustainable world through our business will lead to further business growth. By taking advantage of Nomura's collective expertise and strengths, we will expand into new digital areas in light of structural changes to society and the economy.</p>
      <p>Earning the trust of our clients and all stakeholders is paramount. In December 2019, we established the Nomura Group Code of Conduct. Guided by the Code, we will continue to uphold our longstanding values of entrepreneurship, teamwork and integrity.</p>
      <p>A critical part of my vision for the firm is making sure that our people are happy and excited about what they do, and that we build a company that family and friends can be proud of.</p>
      <p>Nomura has approximately 27,000 employees around the world. Our people are a diverse group of about 90 nationalities of different ages and genders. We believe that the synergies born of this diversity better enable us to quickly adapt to changes in society and meet the needs of our clients.</p>
      <p>We aim to be a financial services group that society needs and our clients trust. We look forward to your continued support.</p>

          <p><b>Studied MPhysics at Exeter University, completed a Summer Internship in 2019, joined the Finance Graduate Programme in 2020</b> </p>
          <p>I came into Banking through an alternative route as I studied MPhysics at the University of Exeter before undertaking the Finance Summer Internship in 2019. Like many others, I applied to quite a few different firms and Nomura’s response time was really fast (I did my first interview one day and the following day I was invited to the Assessment centre) which led me to accept their internship. </p>
          <p>When I joined the Bank as an intern, I was immersed in a world of acronyms and substantial content that I had not come across before, having studied Physics rather than Finance. It was quite a steep learning curve in the beginning but everyone was willing to help or take the time to explain new concepts and processes. It seems like a clichéd statement but asking questions is key to understanding your role so having the confidence to ask questions in the correct way speeds up the learning experience. As an intern or Analyst, many of your daily tasks do not directly relate to university degree content so no one is at a significant disadvantage by coming from a non-financial background. Vey soon after starting, I realised that firms like Nomura are actively looking for people from different backgrounds as diverse skillsets compliment teams in different ways.</p>
          <p>My advice to prospective interns when preparing for interview is to thoroughly research the company and role you are applying for. I read Nomura’s public financial reports, their goals and their principles. When applying this to the interview setting, this shows the interviewer that you have a real interest in the organisation and that you care about the position enough to learn more about the firm to which you apply. The interviewer knows your background and appreciates your level of financial knowledge based on your degree type or prior experience so it is more about getting in the mind-set, thinking logically and being able to solve problems rather than absolute technical or financial knowledge. The way in which you present yourself and come across as a person can be equally influential as often interviewers are keen to assess your cultural or team fit. Many of the soft skills are important, especially as I did not have the technical financial knowledge that others had.</p>
          <p>After joining the firm, I would say that most of my technical skills have developed through learning on the job, company training and the additional financial qualifications you study for and sit during Graduate Training and beyond. However, I built an initial base of technical knowledge through researching many of the fundamental financial concepts and by reading around the markets and the daily financial news on BBC or other sites. You also learn so much on the desk when speaking to managers, colleagues and people across departments. While sitting on a floor with Investment Bankers, you learn a lot through osmosis. </p>
          <p>I enjoy the firm’s culture and outside of my role, I head up the Graduate Newsletter that circulates throughout the Graduate cohort at the firm (Analyst to Associate). As part of this, we interview senior colleagues at the firm (at Vice President Level and above) about their advice and stories. It helps the juniors know who is out there and build peoples’ networks through their visibility and creating topics of conversation. We shadow Graduates, share stories of how they came to Nomura, and inform people who are new to London about some of the upcoming events across the city. There are no schemes that bring together all Graduate Programmes across Nomura, so the Newsletter is a great way to curate a sense of community. </p>
          <p>Due to the size of the bank, you are able to reach out to more people. Your network can be bigger as it is easier to reach out to and find out more about individuals who work outside of your immediate team. Teams are quite small so unlike larger banks, tasks often require you to liaise with different teams on a regular basis. At Nomura there are many learning opportunities outside your immediate role, allowing you to gain exposure cross-divisionally. </p>
          <p>The culture at Nomura is good and its ethos is quite nurturing. People are very approachable which is nice when coming in at a very junior level as individuals are willing to help you and take time out of their busy days to facilitate learning. The multiple mentoring schemes are evidence of this as seniors work to make you comfortable and actually want to work within the firm.</p>

          <p><b>Studied BSc Computer Science, Industrial Placement Year at Nomura 2018 – 2019, Technology Graduate Programme Analyst - 2020</b> </p>
          <p>I joined Nomura as a business Analyst in Tech directly after exams. The first week consisted of 2 days in training (I missed a couple due to my exam timetable and as the Nomura placement starts quite early) and then we went to sit on the desks. As this was back in 2018, everyone who was on industrial placement was in office all the time. I was staffed on the ‘Symphony Project’ [setting up our internal communications system] and was provided with a lot of responsibility from an early stage so it was fun. I also completed an intern project that was a Symphony Bot, which is still running today.</p>
          <p>I first heard of Nomura through the University Careers Fair, which is quite a well-attended event each year. Nomura attended and as a bank (compared to other types of placement organisation) offered a competitive pay and interesting business roles. The main pull to this particular placement was that it was in a business analyst role. As a woman in technology, it was quite rare to see this type of placement as an internship and roles tend to consist of software development or tech support so this option provided an exciting option for a woman in tech. </p>
          <p>As a business analyst, many of my daily tasks worked cross-divisionally and I was fortunate to speak with a lot of different people across the business. While on the Symphony project, I worked with people in the Global Markets Division, Client Ecosystem Team, Investment Banking, Corporate Communications and Legal. Many of these relationships have continued throughout my time here and has enabled me to interact with people globally. Early in my placement year, my line manager moved to a different division within the firm and so I took responsibility of the project, enabling me to experience a very high level of exposure to the business as the lead business analyst on the project, leading meeting and other tasks that were very exciting.</p>
          <p>The best way to make the most of the placement year is by grabbing every opportunity available, and doing so in the first three months is really important. As an intern, teams are not always aware of your capabilities or how much work to assign at the beginning; by offering to take on additional tasks you can demonstrate dependability and in suit you will gain more responsibility. </p>
          <p>Another important aspect was networking. My graduate role is in a different team to that in which I interned and instead with the people I worked alongside on the project. Due to strong performance on the Symphony project, they offered me a graduate position and this is quite a common trend for Industrial Placement interns. By networking and demonstrating your competency in each task or project, you build greater respect from those around you. This way the teams can better understand your skills sets and know how you can add value as a graduate on their team.</p>
          <p>The culture is a key aspect of the firm (as is the terrace bar) and the graduate intake are good friends, which naturally extends to the new graduates and interns as well. In the wider firm, everyone is friendly and always willing to give you their time to answer any questions. I also have good management which is very helpful as a junior. They give many opportunities to take on responsibility and support larger projects of substantial changes in tech. </p>
          <p>Other groups such as the Public Speaking society provide the chance to network outside of your work areas and encounter people I would not have otherwise. Finally, the office location is great and flexible working options within tech (with the option to work from home up to three days a week) make it an enjoyable place to work.</p>

          <p><b>Studied Economics Politics and International Studies at University of Warwick, joined the 2021 Investment Banking Graduate Analyst Training Programme</b> </p>
          <p>I chose Banking as it is a wide-ranging profession where you have the chance to get involved in any sector of the economy, be it Commercial, UK Corporates, Energy and Industrials, etc. There are a huge range of opportunities within investment banking, both sector-specific and global markets so you can pursue whatever piques your interest.</p>
          <p>I first heard about Nomura from a friend who interned here the previous summer and informed me that the London office was one of the most incredible places to work, right on the bank of the Thames! Apart from the impressive real estate Nomura’s USP (unique selling point) is its position and expertise in Eastern markets, being the largest bank in Japan it holds prestige and regional understanding which is unique to Nomura. The majority of the bulge-bracket Investment Banks are western-centric, being European or American-led, the fact that Nomura was different and held a unique culture in this regard was an attractive prospect. </p>
          <p>I joined the Risk Solutions Group (RSG) and completed the Graduate Analyst Training Programme in 2021, during which I particularly enjoyed getting to know the different graduates on the programme even in a mostly virtual format. I really enjoyed doing all the exams as I felt I had a foot in the door of Investment Banking and a better grasp of the knowledge that has ultimately complemented my IB experience. </p>
          <p>RSG sits within the Client Financing Solutions (CFS) function of the Bank. Its role marries both Investment Banking and Global Markets so RSG have an active role within advisory supporting M&A hedging opportunities as well as having a foot in the door in the Global Markets division. While RSG sits in Investment Banking, it also spends a significant amount of its time examining the trajectory of rates and market developments, this combination of advisory and market understanding made the role of significant interest to me.</p>
          <p>On a daily basis we look at different rates across the market (interest rates, inflation rates, currency, FX) and look to hedge our clients’ risk to rate movements. This is particularly important in the current environment as interest rates are continuously on the up driven by spiralling inflationary pressures; the rise in rates will mean that the debt interest rate payments will become prohibitively expensive, to mitigate this scenario we offer hedging instruments to mitigate their future risk exposure. Sometimes it may not seem as glamorous as other parts of banking but it is so interesting particularly in the current market as we are of tantamount importance to the bank and the clients we service.</p>
          <p>The RSG team itself is very energetic, they are all young and dynamic which is a huge plus especially as an Analyst who has recently joined the firm. They are very welcoming, engaging and have a depth and breadth of expertise in the RSG product; I get to work around people who inspire me which helps to provide that extra burst of energy during the day!</p>
          <p>My best advice to prospective interns or Analysts is to be proactive in your learning: do not leave it to other people to teach you and definitely ask questions. Take the initiative to learn for yourself as I have always found it easier to digest new information in my own time, then asking follow-up questions to those with subject matter expertise showing you have done your research in advance. Secondly, say yes to pretty much every opportunity that comes your way, no matter whether you find it daunting or a real challenge at first (e.g. presenting/presentation skills). Thirdly, being present and engaged in all training, be it scheduled as part of the Analyst Programme or information sharing on the desk, will put on will set you in good stead for the start of your career.</p>

          <p><b>LSE</b> </p>
          <p>I completed the Women’s Immersion Spring Insight Programme in 2019 and the Investment Banking Summer Internship in 2020, receiving a full time offer for the Investment Banking Graduate Analyst Programme in 2021. I initially heard about Nomura through university and applied for the Women’s Immersion Programme during my first year. It was a 2-week programme at the London office where we were introduced to the firm, provided technical and soft skills training and supported our allocated teams, which in my case was FIG. The experience was a great introduction to Investment Banking and helped me develop a deeper understanding of the industry.</p>
          <p>Following the insight programme, I was fast-tracked to interviews for the 2020 Summer Internship and secured a place on the Investment Banking Sector Teams track. The insight I gained into the firm and its positioning through the Spring Insight Programme greatly guided my research while preparing to interview. I joined the Healthcare team for the summer programme and really enjoyed my experience so decided to re-join the team as a full-time analyst the following year after graduate training.</p>
          <p>I enjoy working in banking as it is a fast-paced learning environment and at Nomura, you are often exposed to clients at a very early stage. Working in smaller teams gave me opportunities to take on responsibility from the get go; the atmosphere here is entrepreneurial and so proactivity and ownership are key attributes for analysts. Working in a sector team also allows you to understand the industry from a very detailed standpoint whilst working across all verticals. </p>
          <p>The amount of progress I have seen in my work over the course of a year is substantial, especially when it comes to technical skills. My first two months on the healthcare team probably sparked the most amount of learning I have ever achieved in the shortest period of time, degree included. My internship was virtual due to COVID, so it was clear that being in office and around my colleagues gave me a more holistic and in-depth perspective into banking. </p>
          <p>There is a lot of opportunity for growth and I feel like I’m at a stage where I can start to take more ownership of my projects. The responsibility given to me by my seniors really helps personal growth and lays out a clear path for further development. Over the course of the next year, I aim to keep honing my technical skills and present more on calls, both internal and client facing.</p>
          <p>My advice to prospective applicants is to research Nomura and figure out why you want to join this firm and industry over others. Make sure you do read up, prepare adequately and demonstrate your enthusiasm to set yourself up for the summer internship if successful.</p>

          <p><b>Engineering Bachelors, Double Masters at Polytechnico University (Madrid), MiM at HEC Paris with a  Major in Finance, 2020 Summer Intern – Investment Banking Sector Teams </b> </p>
          <p>My decision to pursue Investment Banking was driven by my Masters in Finance. We studied many corporate finance modules and from research I found the role of the investment banker very appealing: to assist clients on their most important financial decisions. As a junior it is a career in which you have a lot of exposure to different industries and in the result of your work has a significant impact. In terms of a learning experience, you end up taking on a lot more responsibility than in more traditional roles as this is a fast-paced industry. The skills that you develop as an investment banker are very transferable into alternative careers in finance.</p>
          <p>I heard about Nomura at my University Careers Fair, where one of the Spanish alumni attended on behalf of the firm and told me about their internship there. They shared insights about their experience and demonstrated how the firm allowed juniors to gain a lot of exposure from the offset, which was appealing in comparison to some of its peers. </p>
          <p>Nomura is entrepreneurial and your ideas are supported in the structure of the firm. When you start as a first year Analyst, you will end up doing tasks that others may not have the opportunity to help with until at Associate level by assisting in meetings and proposing ideas or solutions to client problems. It is a very welcoming place to work, learn and grow. Most importantly, the people at Nomura were extremely nice and working with people you enjoy sending time with is incredibly important within this industry.</p>
          <p>Following this, I applied for the 2020 summer internship which was virtual due to the impact of the pandemic – it was different to the normal internship as it was for 5 weeks. The experience was enjoyable and included some great training and exposure for the team. I interned in the Equity Advisory team and re-joined as an analyst in the same team the following year. </p>
          <p>As an Analyst, my tasks have changed significantly since joining Nomura as the team is more focussed on private placements which is equally engaging and challenging. The daily tasks can vary a lot, for example, if you are in a live transaction, you can be assisting a client (e.g. a start up in a growth stage) to risk capital to continue financing their operations and facilitate growth. Our function is to look for investors, advise on and structure the process, and finally help the client prepare marketing materials or business plans in a way that is attractive to investors. You work hand in hand with seniors in the team making this a very flat structure. </p>
          <p>Another side of the job relates to business development and generating opportunities by looking for exciting companies that may be in a position of needing capital. You can then discuss this with your seniors and other teams to determine whether this might originate to approach them and prepare a pitch. This in particular is a process in which juniors become heavily involved. So overall, it is not just spreadsheets and PowerPoints.</p>
          <p>My advice to incoming interns or aspiring bankers it to be open-minded when it comes to different opportunities on the route to your chosen career and to be resilient. It is not a requirement for you to attend certain universities or follow a straightforward path. You should be open to accepting different working experiences and gaining exposure in more than one specific area to fully understand what you will enjoy in your career and what you might actually excel in.</p>
          <p>It is important to have the correct attitude, be willing to learn and to help. As an Analyst, you will be staffed in very attractive client pitches in conjunction with other less glamorous tasks that are equally integral to the courses of business and your team’s success. Be proactive and try to learn many transferrable skills at university. Finally, grow your network as investment banking is truly a people-centric business. </p>

          <p><b>Studied BA in War Studies and International Relations at Kings College London, completed Global Markets Graduate Training in 2019</b> </p>
          <p><b>How did you join the Investment Banking Graduate Programme?</b></p>
          <p>I first came to Nomura via the off-cycle internship interview process for the Italian Geographical Coverage Team that was searching for a junior to support across Assets, Credit, Rates and FX. I interviewed in spring 2019 and joined the Global Markets Graduate Training in August 2019.</p>
          <p><b>What happened during the Graduate Programme?</b></p>
          <p>We first completed a month of training then joined the Graduate Programme in office in September. During the month of August, the Graduate Training brought together the Global Analyst class from across Hong Kong, New York, Singapore and Tokyo to train in London. </p>
          <p>During the month of training, we had daily classes covering the basics of financial products and economic theory. I found these extremely useful as I did not come from an academic financial background so it helped bring me up to speed. At the end of each week, we were set mini-assessments to check our knowledge and also challenges in teams of seven or eight individuals from across the globe. Examples of these included a Trading Simulation in a Beta environment and Client Pitching exercise in which we came up with a trading idea, which we presented before seniors, colleagues and peers. This was empowering and gave a soft start from the zero to one hundred you experience when coming into GM. </p>
          <p>Further, two or three times a week, we went to workshops hosted by Nomura employees who gave insights in to their specific business areas and daily activities. This was really interesting as firstly we had immediate access to senior people who would then know who you are from the start of your time on the floor but also enabled us to learn about the business.</p>
          <p>In the first few months following training, we attended development programme sessions during which external companies gave lectures and soft skills training on topics including: how to work alongside people with contrasting personalities; how to build your personal brand; and how to network effectively. Trainings re-created realistic scenarios and reflected on ‘what was right/wrong about the situation’ and gave actionable points on the best ways to ask for information from seniors and highlighted constructive approaches to difficult situations. </p>
          <p><b>As you come from a non-financial academic background, how did you develop your financial knowledge outside of the Nomura training programme?</b></p>
          <p>There were two avenues through which I developed the knowledge: firstly through studies for the FCA exams and secondly due to having prior experience in financial institutions. </p>
          <p>In my role, I must be FCA certified in order to speak with and advise clients. This required me to take three very intense, finance-specific exams that caught me up on a year or two of financial knowledge that you would otherwise learn at university within two months of study. As I could not fulfil my function without the accreditation, my manager allowed me to study during work hours. Everyone around the office was incredibly helpful in responding to any questions and providing additional resources (through learning portals and colleagues’ own materials).</p>
          <p>Nomura’s graduate scheme was not my first as previously I had undertaken a graduate scheme at an alternative financial institution. While not at a bank, the role provided opportunities to speak with clients within investment banking and wealth management that formed a base level of knowledge and sparked my personal interest.</p>
          <p>Overall, I am still learning as the job requires continual development, however the first four months of the graduate programme got me up to speed with someone with a financial degree. </p>
          <p><b>As an Associate, what are your current responsibilities and/or highlights you can discuss?</b></p>
          <p>I received my first (small) client batch during my first year at Nomura. I was really grateful for the amount of trust and support that my manager put in me. He helped me when doing my first cold calls and guided on the best way to present myself effectively in front of other traders when I had to call them to ask for prices. Following on from this, I developed, gained more clients and started to specialise into different areas. Currently, I have a roster of around 25 clients who I cover for both rates and credit. Over the past year and a half, my specialty area has really taken shape by becoming the subject expert within my team and further for Asia Credit. </p>
          <p>One of the most significant challenges faced was the fall-out of BREXIT as this forced many people who covered geographically-specific teams to move to different countries and cover alternative clients. While it was a challenge, it also provided an opportunity to inherit clients in the Italian credit space and enabled me to grow into this area and take ownership of sales for the Italian market at the firm. I have developed great relationships with traders in Hong Kong which has made me the go to person for information about the market on products like China Credit. This is definitely one of my biggest achievements at Nomura to date. </p>
          <p><b>What do you feel sets Nomura apart from its competitors?</b></p>
          <p>The work environment and the culture are different to other banks. I cannot identify whether the culture is influenced from top down or vice versa but the environment and relationships that I have experienced with people even at very senior levels are amazing. We joke, we laugh and if I need help in any aspect of my life I would be really comfortable to ask my manager or colleagues for advice. </p>
          <p>For example, I was talking in office about how I had bought a new ceiling fan and did not know how to put it up. One of the Executive Directors from FX (we don’t even work together) who sits in front of me asked me to show him a picture and he could come by and help you fix it as he has a knack for it! I would have never imagined a trading floor with that kind of environment, where people cultivate actual friendships and enjoy going for a drink together or where someone comes back from lunch with ice creams for the floor. I think that kind of environment is pretty unique to Nomura.</p>

        <article> <img src="images/pxiFGdPo2TRC.jpg">
          <p><b>Studied Master’s in Applied Mathematics from University of Cambridge and Theoretical Physics at UCL, completed Summer Internships in 2018 & 2019, joined the GM Graduate Programme in 2020, now: eFX Quant </b> </p>
          <p>I have always liked maths and coding and have interests in current affairs, so I thought that banking, and in particular Global Markets, was a place in which I could bring some of those elements together. Currently I code in a number of languages, applying statistics and machine learning techniques to our systematic FX trading business, in an environment driven by politics and topical events – it’s been a great position to combine my interests in one place. </p>
          <p>I completed two internships at Nomura, both within Global Markets. The first was rotational across GM desks and focussed on credit trading, credit structuring and an area called Client Ecosystems. I was offered a role in one of these teams following the internship but it was not quite in line with my career aspirations and interests, so I worked with the Graduate Recruitment Team to take on a second internship the following year in the AI Labs team. I now work as an eFX Quant, building algorithmic trading strategies for our Electronic Foreign Exchange business.</p>
          <p>The experience on my team has been excellent, everyone is super friendly and knowledgeable. That which stands out the most about working with them is that I am treated as a complete equal to other team members even though I am (at multiple levels) more junior than they are. I’ve been given a huge amount of responsibility, leading projects which directly affect trading decisions across our global franchise, and my opinions are treated with the same amount of sincerity as those of my seniors, allowing me to influence big decisions and deliver value to the team.</p>
          <p>My advice to incoming interns or graduates would be to focus on attention to detail. Both banks and markets are big, complex structures, and understanding the details goes a long way to help you stand out from your peers. In my world, paying attention to details means projects are delivered right the first time, allowing us to deliver immediate value to the firm and our clients. Focussing on details allows you to become a specialist – be prepared to teach yourself new skills, apply them to solve problems with a degree of perfectionist attitude, and you can quickly become a highly valued member of the team. </p>

        <article> <img src="images/Lyp30lIwz5Yz.png">
          <p><b>Master in Management, Corporate Finance Track at ESSEC Business School </b> </p>
          <p>Following my years studying corporate finance at ESSEC Business School, I decided to do an internship in Investment Banking to put my knowledge in practice. The role of the Investment Banker intern is truly interesting as you have the opportunity to work on several deals across a wide range of sectors. This allows you to really know what you like and where you are the best to better chose where and how you want to start your career. </p>
          <p>I heard about Nomura through my previous internship where a former colleague told me it was a very active office in Paris with a dedicated team. I contacted former interns from the Nomura Paris office who told me that the firm offers strong exposure for interns compared to other investment banking companies and allows interns to gain strong experience while working with more experienced colleague. During my year at ESSEC I studied in Singapore for 6 months and was attracted to the Asian culture, Nomura was the perfect company to bring together Asia and banking. After two rounds of interview, I joined Nomura as an intern for a 6-month off-cycle program in January 2023.</p>
          <p>From an intern perspective, Nomura offers a challenging and dynamic work environment. Interns are given the opportunity to work on various projects and contribute to the success of the company. They are exposed to various aspects of the business and have the chance to learn from experienced professionals with longstanding careers. Nomura places a strong emphasis on mentorship and career development, providing interns with guidance and support throughout their internship.</p>
          <p>During the very first days of my internship I was on boarded on two ongoing sell-sides in different sectors. This allowed me to gain a lot of exposure as I worked closely with the analysts and associates in the team to create the marketing materials for the deals. Over the 6-months of my internship I gained a lot of experience and was able to work more autonomously on bigger and more challenging tasks. Eventually I rejoined the team as a full-time analyst in July 2023. </p>
			<p>One advice I would give to a future interns is to build good relationships and trust with you team. The more your team believes in you the more exposure you are going to get. It is key to always have a good attitude and be detailed oriented to achieve your goals. The Investment Banking sector is full of opportunities and if you show willingness you will have the opportunity to truly build your career.</p>

        <article> <img src="images/SiUcjxgm3TDr.jpg">
          <p><b>Bachelor’s in Business Administration, Master of Finance at Frankfurt School of Finance & Management with concentration in Corporate Finance </b> </p>
          <p>My interest in investment banking sparked during my studies, as I discovered the variety of responsibilities the job facilitates: From advising clients on large, complex financial transactions such as an acquisition or merger, to help conducting a capital raise and act as strategic advisor on financial decisions. In detail, this entails a combination of financial modelling and the client facing aspects of the job. As a junior banker, you will have exposure to all kinds of industries, and you will take on responsibility and ownership for you work from day 1. The extremely challenging and fast-paced environment offers a steep learning curve and exposure to high profile transactions, equipping you with a well sought-after skillset. </p>
          <p>I heard about Nomura and found out about their strong positioning and expertise in the Eastern markets, being the largest bank in Japan. As a world renown bank with its prestigious reputation and regional understanding, Nomura is able to attract reputable clients and thus offering the opportunity to work on meaningful deals and gain valuable experience. Moreover, the smaller team structures enable greater responsibility early on, which is unique to Nomura.</p>
          <p>I applied to the Nomura Off-Cycle internship at the Frankfurt Office to gain first-hand experience of the job. During the first week, you receive a structured training program, before you support the team on the preparation of marketing materials and the day-to-day execution of live mandates. The progress made over a short period of time, especially in regard of technical skills, gave me an in-depth perspective of investment banking.</p>
          <p>At the end of my internship, I received the return offer to join Nomura as Investment Banking Analyst in their Frankfurt IBD team, and completed the Graduate Analyst Training Programme in 2023. This 4-week training program in New York, US is designed to bring everyone up to speed and prepare you for the desk. On the programme, I particularly enjoyed getting to know the graduates from all around the globe, as you will work on cross-border projects alongside colleagues in other Nomura offices worldwide. </p>
			<p>My advice to prospective interns or aspiring Analysts is to be curious, come prepared and ask questions. With the right attitude and the willingness to learn, everyone around you will be happy to teach you and answer your questions. You will be surrounded by highly skilled professionals with years of extensive experience working on very complex and interesting transactions, and you can benefit from this expertise. Be proactive in your learning and bring the passion to accelerate as there will be a lot of room for growth. </p>

              <h3>What's involved?</h3>
              <p>Technology at Nomura involves working with, and designing, state-of-the-art information technology and risk management systems. These are the systems that can often give us that crucial, split-second edge over our competitors. Work ranges from infrastructure support and deployment to in-house development of complex modelling software and applications. </p>
              <p> This programme will give you the opportunity to develop new applications that keep us at the forefront of technology. You’ll develop an impressive level of technical knowledge, using a range of technologies (Java, C#, C++, SQL, Python, Perl, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and others) and frameworks (Spring, Maven, Camel, WPF, Node, React, and many others). Depending on your role, you’ll gain an understanding of different financial products, and build a valuable knowledge of risk management techniques and live trade analysis. </p>
              <p> There is a wide breadth of roles available in technology. Your role will fit into one of the below:</p>
              <p> <b>Business Analysis</b> – To help bridge the gap between the worlds of Technology and the business, Business Analysts are the intermediary through which each side can communicate effectively. Each modification we make to our in-house software requires complete understanding and agreement from both sides as to how things are to be changed, and as a Business Analyst you will facilitate this. You’ll be meeting regularly with business representatives to understand the problems that are currently occurring, and will be translating these problems into concrete requirements for the Development and Support teams. Analytical skills are a must for this role, as well as the ability to express an idea in more than one domain language.</p>
              <p> <b>Software Development</b> – Bespoke software is at the heart of everything we do, and as a software developer you will help build out our ecosystem to help our clients and traders create and maintain a competitive advantage over other banks and organisations on the street. We write a large proportion of our software in-house and you could be involved with anything from generating real-time risk measures for our traders, to ensuring that payments to other companies are correctly collated, calculated and executed. As a software developer at Nomura, you will be designing, implementing and deploying solutions to meet rapidly changing business and regulatory needs. Strong coding skills and a logical outlook are a must. </p>
              <p> <b>Technical Support</b> – To support the many systems that are written in house, our technical support teams are the first line of communication between our business users and Technology. As a member of one of our dedicated teams you’ll be doing anything from diagnosing and remediating issues in complex system flows to investigating previously unknown issues, all while in contact with traders or other business staff in a fast-paced environment. Excellent communication and technology knowledge are required to get the ‘big picture’ and disseminate information to find a solution to issues.</p>
              <p> Bear in mind, that not all jobs fit into one of these categories, and can sometimes span two or all three! </p>
              <p> Your role will be in the context of one of our IT divisions:</p>
              <p> <b>CTS</b> – Corporate Technology Services is responsible for delivering and supporting business applications to Operations; Finance; Compliance; Investment Banking; and the rest of the Corporate divisions.

EIS offer technology services that underpin the banks application landscape, and provide front to back end user services that operate across technology and business disciplines. Offering an ever broader range of career options, EIS provide not only technology pathways in development, product engineering or technical support, but provide consultative services that form delivery of solutions within the bank spanning Business Analysis, Project Management, and Governance.</p>

              <p> <b>Risk IT</b> – Risk IT supports the Risk Management division by developing and maintaining software solutions that calculate market and credit risk exposures and provide group-wide risk management capabilities in line with the firms’ risk appetite and regulatory requirements.</p>

                  <h3>Focus - Structure and Plan your Preparation</h3>
                  <p>Firstly, you should congratulate yourself in being selected for interview stage and have confidence in your ability. Secondly ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>What will the interviewers want to know?
                      <ul>
                        <li>An interview is not an opportunity to divulge everything you know- instead you need to focus on what is relevant to the company and the position you’re applying for</li>
                        <li>To identify what is most relevant, you will need to fully understand the role, it’s requirements and the key skills and competencies required</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>How are you going to sell yourself?
                      <ul>
                        <li>What is your unique selling point? I.e. what sets you apart from the competition?</li>
                        <li>How do you want the interviewers to remember you after the interview – what key points do you want them to recall?</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>How will you be assessed?
                      <ul>
                        <li>You can’t start your preparation until you know what you are preparing for</li>
                        <li>Read the interview format thoroughly to identify how you will be assessed (i.e. Interviews, case study exercises, and tests). If you’re unsure – ask.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>What are the core competencies required for the role?
                      <ul>
                        <li>Your interview performance and ultimately if you are successful or not, will be dependent on how you perform against core competencies</li>
                        <li>Identify what are the key competencies required for the role and for the company</li>
                        <li>What examples do you have to demonstrate each competency? Have you considered examples outside academia (i.e. sports, music, drama, volunteering, charity, mentoring, societies or other extracurricular activities) </li>
                        <li>What achievements are you most proud of and why – which competency do they demonstrate?</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                  <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
                  <p>Interviewers will use a variety of questions to assess your ability against each competency. Ensure you are familiar with each type of question and how to structure your answers accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Types of interview questions may include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Competency based questions
                      <ul>
                        <li>These require you to provide a real life example to explain how you behaved in a certain situation. Past behaviour is used as an indicator to assess potential future performance</li>
                        <li>Delivering a structured answer is crucial - research the STAR method to guide you</li>
                        <li>Top Tip: Ensure your examples are varied and recent (the more recent the past behaviour; the greater the indication of future ability)</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Technical questions
                      <ul>
                        <li>Practice! There are many online resources or books available with practice questions</li>
                        <li>Questions may include basic accounting, valuation, brain teasers and mental arithmetic</li>
                        <li>Top tip: Brain teasers – the key is not the answer; it is the how you derive at the answer. The interviewer is assessing your ability to formulate a logical and methodical response</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>CV and application questions
                      <ul>
                        <li>Ensure you are able to discuss all aspects of your CV confidently and identify any obvious questions the interviewer may ask</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Industry related questions
                      <ul>
                        <li>Interviewers will assess your interest, understanding and industry knowledge</li>
                        <li>Top tip: Form an opinion – digest the information you read and form your own judgment. Use facts and statistics to back up your conclusions</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                  <p>There are a number of readily available resources to help you prepare. Make sure you fully utilise all resources available to you. These may include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Online resources: Company website, press releases, annual reports, research publications, social media and online forums</li>

                  <h3>Your Questions</h3>
                  <p>An interview is a two way process. It is an opportunity for you to assess if the company, role and culture is right for you. You will be given time to ask questions at the end of the interview, so you should ensure you use this time wisely. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Plan questions to ask in advance - ensure they are relevant, well-thought-out and to the point</li>
                    <li>Show you’ve done your research and use the opportunity to demonstrate your interest</li>

                  <h3>Plan the Interview Day</h3>
                  <p>Preparing as much as possible in advance of your interview day will remove many of the inevitable nerves associated with the process.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Before the interview:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Dress professionally. Plan you outfit the day before and ensure you wear corporate attire</li>
                        <li>Be Punctual. Plan your route and account for delays in public transport</li>
                        <li>Aim to arrive 15 minutes before your interview start time. Contact us if problems arise and ensure you have noted the name and contact details of who to contact should this happen</li>
                        <li>Take a notebook, a pen (that works) and a calculator. Take a copy of your CV and application form</li>
                        <li>Remember: Be polite to everyone you meet, your interview begins as soon as you walk through the door of the building</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>During the Interview:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Ensure your mobile phone is turned off</li>
                        <li>Listen carefully to questions you are asked. If you are unclear about anything, ask for clarification</li>
                        <li>Be honest. Back up your answers with real examples. If you exaggerate or lie it will show up in pre-employment checks</li>
                        <li>Relax - whether you are successful or not, the interview is a valuable learning experience. Make sure you get something out of it.</li>
                        <li>Close the interview – thank your interviewer for their time. If you’ve enjoyed the experience and you look forward to hearing about the next steps – tell us</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>After your Interview:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Be responsive. Following the interview, go back to your recruiter and continue to build a relationship</li>
                        <li>If you are offered a position it is unprofessional to renege (to accept and then later decline). This could be the first impression you create in the industry - you never know what the future holds</li>

              <p>Final round interviews (for Investment Banking and Global Markets) will involve a case study. Case study interviews are designed to show us your problem-solving skills and analytical thinking. We will also be looking at how you present yourself and how good your communication skills are under pressure.</p>
              <h3>Why use case studies?</h3>
              <p>We use case study interviews because they provide us with insights into your thought processes. Problem solving is often independent of any particular subject expertise you may have and we want to see how you would tackle any of a very wide range of potential case study questions. We are interested in your expertise in general business, your ability to apply your formal education and work experience in an analytical and creative way, and your raw intelligence.</p>
              <h3>What kind of questions should I expect?</h3>
              <p>Often a case study is business-related, but it could touch on anything - the question is not designed to test any previously acquired knowledge or experience. You will be asked to prepare an exercise from information given to you when you arrive at the interview. You will have between 45 and 60 minutes to read the data and compile your notes. You will then be asked to make recommendations. Remember, there are no right answers. You should consider all lines of argument and then present one as your chosen opinion, mentioning why you discarded the other possibilities.</p>

                <li>Practice extensively beforehand. Research case study examples on the internet and use them to build your experience. </li>
                <li>Ensure that you are able to present your pitch concisely and articulately. You will have a very limited time to get the main points across before the interviewer starts asking you questions on your rationale.</li>
                <li>Listen carefully to the question. If you like, repeat it back to your interviewer to make sure you have understood fully.</li>
                <li>Don't jump into your answer immediately. Take a moment to collect your thoughts, and get ready. </li>
                <li>Remember that we are not looking for a 'correct' answer. It is the route you have taken to reach your answer that is important to us. </li>
                <li>Ask questions. Asking the right questions will be key to proving that you have the analytical skills we expect. The interview is meant to be interactive.</li>
                <li>Construct a logical framework with which to explore the critical issues of the case.</li>
                <li>Prioritize the issues and objectives. Don't get bogged down trying to deal with every aspect.</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to think outside the box. Creativity is seen as a major asset at Nomura.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><b>CAGR:</b> “Compound Annual Growth Rate” – the year-over-year percentage growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time </p>
              <p><b>Capex:</b> Acronym meaning Capital Expenditures, that are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, industrial buildings or equipment. This type of outlay is made by companies to maintain or increase the scope of their operations</p>

              <p><b>Discount rate:</b> The interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate takes into account the time value of money (the idea that money available now is worth more than the same amount of money available in the future because it could be earning interest) and the risk or uncertainty of the anticipated future cash flows (which might be less than expected).</p>

              <p><b>Market Cap:</b> Market capitalisation or market cap is a value of a corporation as determined by the market price of its common stock (shares). It is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current market price of the share</p>

              <p><b>Swap:</b> highly liquid financial derivative instruments in which two parties agree to exchange interest rate cash flows, based on a specified notional amount from a fixed rate to a floating rate (or vice versa) or from one floating rate to another.</p>
              <p><b>Swaption:</b> An option granting its owner the right but not the obligation to enter into an underlying interest rate swap. A payer swaption gives the owner of the swaption the right to enter into a swap where they pay the fixed leg and receive the floating leg. A receiver swaption gives the owner of the swaption the right to enter into a swap in which they will receive the fixed leg, and pay the floating leg.</p>
              <p><b>Ultimate forward rate (UFR):</b> the theoretical forward interest rate to which forward rates converge. </p>
              <p><b>Yield to maturity: </b>Discount rate at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (coupons and principal) is equal to the price of the bond.</p>
